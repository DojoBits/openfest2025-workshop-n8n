## Workshop Abstract

With over 41.9k GitHub stars, n8n is everywhere—from AI-powered automation and data collection to CRM, IoT, and complex workflow orchestration. This popular open-source platform is highly flexible, easily extendable through hundreds of community-contributed integrations, and can be deployed both on-premises and in the cloud.

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to get started with n8n and see just how easy it is to deploy, run, and build workflows, whether at home or within your own infrastructure. We’ll guide you through automating routine tasks, creating your own low-code workflows, and unlocking the power of AI by building assistants and agents. You’ll also discover how to expose your n8n workflows through n8n MCP servers for advanced agent integration and orchestration.

Whether you’re a total beginner or already tinkering with automation, you’ll leave with practical recipes and the confidence to elevate your productivity—with (almost) no code!
